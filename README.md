# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
 
## Overview:
### The purpose of the analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results:
- A majority of those retiring are in senior positions

- Because most of those retiring are in senior positions, many newer employees will need to be trained to fill those positions.

- There are 1,549 employees qualified for the mentorship program.

- Even if we only count the number of senior staff and senior engineers, there are over 50,000 employees leaving.


## Summary:

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

#### 72,458 total roles will need to be filled.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

#### Each retiring employee would need to mentor roughly 47 employees to fill in the missing roles. While this would technically be possible, I don't see this being plausible.
